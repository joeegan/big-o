    <h2>O(n)</h2>
    <p>The algorithm is as efficient as the size of its data. Also known as 'Linear'.
    <br/>i.e. <code>algo([1,2,3])</code> will operate 3 times.</p>

    <h2>O(n^2)</h2>
    <p>This algorithm is increasing its operations <code>n * n</code>. Also known as 'Exponential'. <br/>i.e. <code>algo([1,2,3])</code> will make 3 * 3 operations, 9.</p>
