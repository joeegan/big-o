    <h1>Big O</h1>
    <p class='strap'>A means to describe the efficiency of algorithms.</p>
    <p><strong>O</strong> refers to the 'order' of the function (the growth rate of its operations)</p>

    <h2>Ðž(<i>n</i>)</h2>
    <p>The algorithm is as efficient as the size of its data. Also known as 'Linear'.
    <br/>i.e. <code>algo([1,2,3])</code> will operate 3 times.</p>

    <h2>O(<i>n<sup>2</sup></i>)</h2>
    <p>This algorithm is increasing its operations <code>n * n</code>. Also known as 'Quadratic'. <br/>i.e. <code>algo([1,2,3])</code> will make 3 * 3 operations, 9.</p>

    <h2>O(<i>log n</i>)</h2>
    <p>This algorithm increases its operations logarthimically <code>log n</code>. Also known as 'Logarithmic'.<br/>
    O(log n) operates less times than the dataset's size.<br/>
    This is apparent in classic binary search algorithms where the dataset continuously halved.</p>

    <h2>O(<i>n log n</i>)</h2>
    <p>This is the average complexity of a quicksort algorithm where the dataset is continuously partitioned.</p>
